<h1 class="title">Neat example of generating functions</h1>
</header>
<p>Consider that even if a die is fair, if we throw two of those dice,
we have a 1/6 chance of rolling a 7, even though there are 11 possible
outcomes. The probability of each outcome (a sum of 2 to 12) is not
equal to each other. We might wonder if it’s possible to change our die
so that there <em>is</em> an equal probability of each outcome – that
is, there is a 1/11 probability each of rolling a sum from 2 to 12.</p>
<p>The answer is no.</p>
<h3 id="unreasonably-effective-generating-functions">Unreasonably
effective: generating functions</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(p_1, \dots, p_6\)</span> be the
probability of rolling a <span class="math inline">\(1, \dots,
6\)</span> respectively with our die. We can define the polynomial,
which we will call the <strong>generating function</strong> of the
probabilities:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(x) = p_1x + p_2x^2 + \dots + p_6x^6
\]</span> Don’t worry too much about the properties of this polynomial
for now. We are most concerned with something neat that happens when we
multiply this polynomial by itself. Let’s go over an example to see:</p>
<p><strong>Example: a fair die.</strong> A fair die has probabilities
<span class="math inline">\(p_1 = \dots = p_6 = \frac{1}{6}\)</span>.
Then the generating function is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{6}x + \frac{1}{6}x^2 + \dots + \frac{1}{6}x^6
\]</span> Consider what happens when we multiply <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> by itself:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(x)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{6}x + \frac{1}{6}x^2 + \dots +
\frac{1}{6}x^6\right)\left(\frac{1}{6}x + \frac{1}{6}x^2 + \dots +
\frac{1}{6}x^6\right)
\]</span> What is the coefficient of, say for example, <span
class="math inline">\(x^4\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(f(x)^2\)</span>? Well, to expand this polynomial,
we choose one term from the left factor and one term in the right
factor, and for it to contribute to the coefficient of <span
class="math inline">\(x^4\)</span>, the two terms we do choose must have
powers of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> that sum to <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span>. In this case,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\left(\frac{1}{6}x\right)\left(\frac{1}{6}x^3\right) +
\left(\frac{1}{6}x^2\right)\left(\frac{1}{6}x^2\right) +
\left(\frac{1}{6}x^3\right)\left(\frac{1}{6}x\right) = \frac{1}{36}x^4 +
\frac{1}{36}x^4 + \frac{1}{36}x^4 = \frac{1}{12}x^4
\]</span> Remarkably, the probability of rolling a <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span> with two of our fair dice is <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{12}\)</span>. We could make a table, but
we could also note that the three ways of rolling a <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span> are (a) if we roll <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> with the first die and <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span> with the second die, (b) if we roll
<span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> with both dice, or (c) if we roll
<span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> with our first die and <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> with our second die. And in all three
cases, the probability of rolling a specific outcome with <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> die is <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{6}\)</span>, so the probability of each
case over all is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{6} \times
\frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}\)</span>. Adding the probability of all three
cases together yields an overall probability of <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{12}\)</span>.</p>
<p>By multiplying <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> by itself, we
are modelling the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>In general.</strong> Let <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> be generating functions for two dice
with probabilities <span class="math inline">\(p_1, \dots, p_6\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(q_1, \dots, q_6\)</span> respectively.
Then their product has, for the coefficient of <span
class="math inline">\(x^n\)</span>, the probability of rolling a sum of
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> when we roll both dice.
Specifically, it is a useful exercise to show that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(x)g(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{12} \left( \sum_{k=1}^n
\underbrace{p_{k}}_{\text{rolling $k$ with the first die}} \times
\underbrace{q_{n-k}}_{\text{rolling $n-k$ with the second die}} \right)
x^n
\]</span> I added a note so you can hopefully see <em>why</em>
multiplying these two polynomials together represents the probabilities
of each outcome. When <span class="math inline">\(f = g\)</span>, then
the product represents the probabilities for two of the same die.</p>
<h3 id="solving-the-problem">Solving the problem</h3>
<p>Assume that there is a die where if we roll two of those dice, there
is a 1/11 probability each of rolling a sum from 2 to 12. Or in the
language of generating functions, there is a generating function <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> for die probabilities <span
class="math inline">\(p_1, \dots, p_6\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(x) = p_1x + p_2x^2 + \dots + p_6x^6
\]</span> such that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(x)^2 = \frac{1}{11}x^2 + \dots + \frac{1}{11}x^{12}
\]</span> We can factor <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> as <span
class="math display">\[
f(x) = a_0(x-a_1)\dots(x-a_6)
\]</span> Squaring <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> simply doubles
the multiplicity of each root, so every root has even multiplicity:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(x)^2 = a_0^2(x-a_1)^2\dots(x-a_6)^2
\]</span> But notice that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{11}x^2 + \dots + \frac{1}{11}x^{12} &amp;= \frac{1}{11}x^2
(1+x+\dots+x^{10})
\end{align*}
\]</span> And <span class="math display">\[
1+x+\dots+x^{10} = \frac{x^{11} - 1}{x-1}
\]</span> We can factor <span class="math inline">\(x^{11} - 1\)</span>
with its roots of unity: <span class="math display">\[
x^{11} - 1 = (x-1)(x - e^{2\pi i/11}) (x - e^{4\pi i/11}) \dots
(x-e^{20\pi i/11})
\]</span> So <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
1+x+\dots+x^{10} &amp;= \frac{x^{11} - 1}{x-1} \\
&amp;= (x - e^{2\pi i/11}) (x - e^{4\pi i/11}) \dots (x-e^{20\pi i/11})
\\
\frac{1}{11}x^2 + \dots + \frac{1}{11}x^{12} &amp;= \frac{1}{11}x^2 (x -
e^{2\pi i/11}) (x - e^{4\pi i/11}) \dots (x-e^{20\pi i/11})
\end{align*}
\]</span> But this factorization contains roots with multiplicity <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, when we established earlier that <span
class="math inline">\(f^2\)</span> has roots of even multiplicity, so
the generating function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> we wanted
to construct at the start does not exist. The verdict: there is no die,
even a biased one, where if we roll two of those dice, there is a 1/11
probability each of rolling a sum from 2 to 12.</p>
