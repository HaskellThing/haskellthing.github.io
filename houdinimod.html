<h1 class="title">An interesting use of modular arithmetic (Part 1)</h1>
</header>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(a \geq 1\)</span> be an integer, and
consider the function <span class="math inline">\(f: \mathbb{Z} \to
\mathbb{Z}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(n) = \left \lfloor n + \frac{n}{a} \right \rfloor
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\lfloor \cdot \rfloor\)</span> is
the floor function. We want to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(f(n) \not\equiv a \pmod{a+1}\)</span> for all
<span class="math inline">\(n \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>. First, consider
that the first <span class="math inline">\(a - 1\)</span> values are</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(0), \dots, f(a-1) \equiv 0, \dots, a-1 \pmod n
\]</span></p>
<p>as <span class="math inline">\(\frac{n}{a} &lt; 1\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(n \leq a-1\)</span>, so the floor of <span
class="math inline">\(n + \frac{n}{a}\)</span> would just be <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. But</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(a) = \lfloor a + 1 \rfloor \equiv 0 \pmod{a+1}
\]</span></p>
<p>There seems to be a cycle here. Perhaps <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is periodic <span
class="math inline">\(\bmod{a+1}\)</span> with period <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>: that is, <span
class="math inline">\(f(n) \equiv f(n+ak) \pmod{a+1}\)</span> for all
<span class="math inline">\(k \geq 0\)</span>. Well, let’s verify:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
f(n + ak) &amp;= \left \lfloor n + ak + \frac{n + ak}{a} \right \rfloor
\\
&amp;= \left \lfloor n + \frac{n}{a} + ak + k \right \rfloor \\
&amp;= \left \lfloor n + \frac{n}{a} \right \rfloor + ak + k \\
&amp;= \left \lfloor n + \frac{n}{a} \right \rfloor + k(a+1) \\
&amp;\equiv \left \lfloor n + \frac{n}{a} \right \rfloor \equiv f(n)
\pmod{a+1}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>And we can use the division algorithm to express any integer <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(ak +
r\)</span> for a remainder <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq r &lt;
a\)</span>. So</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(ak + r) \equiv f(r) \not\equiv a \pmod n
\]</span></p>
<h3 id="what-happened">What happened?</h3>
<p>In chess, there is little reason to pay for a chess engine (a program
that plays and analyzes chess). Why? Because of two open-source engines
called Stockfish and Leela Chess Zero, which have consistently been the
two strongest chess engines in recent times. But for those who are rich,
there are a lot of engines one could buy. One of the most popular
choices is (or at least was) Houdini. Yet it turned out, those who
bought Houdini might just have paid for Stockfish without knowing.</p>
<p><a
href="https://groups.google.com/g/fishcooking/c/DygaIdBvJm0/m/cjtMosvdBQAJ?pli=1">This
post</a> on the Stockfish “FishCooking” (ha. ha.) forum claims that
Houdini is a clone of Stockfish based on leaked source code. Now that
isn’t damning evidence on its own, even if there isn’t a financial
incentive for a free open-source engine to claim a competitor as a
ripoff. But <a
href="https://groups.google.com/g/fishcooking/c/DygaIdBvJm0/m/NbJuijtnBQAJ">a
user</a> replying to the post made a great observation. In the claimed
to be leaked source code, which is written in C++, there is an
interesting line (<em>the comment is mine</em>):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre

<span id="cb1-8"><a href="#cb1-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let me explain the code. Chess engines report the number of “<a
href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Nodes_per_Second">nodes per
second</a>”, which roughly measures how fast a chess engine is, and this
<code>ThreadPool::bezochte_knopen</code> function calculates the nodes
per second and returns it. The Houdini developer not only wants to avoid
reporting similar nodes per second to Stockfish, but also probably got a
bit greedy and wanted to inflate its nodes per second so “their” engine
looks better than Stockfish. So here comes this line:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode cpp"><code class="sourceCode cpp"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>knopen <span class="op">+=</span> knopen <span class="op">/</span> <span class="dv">7</span><span class="op">;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here’s the problem though. <code>knopen</code> (the nodes per second
reported) is an integer type (of <code>uint64_t</code>), and when
dividing an integer by an integer, C++ takes the quotient and discards
the fractional part to yield the result:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The binary / operator yields the quotient, and the binary % operator
yields the remainder from the division of the first expression by the
second. If the second operand of / or % is zero the behavior is
undefined. For integral operands the / operator yields the algebraic
quotient with any <strong>fractional part discarded</strong>; if the
quotient a/b is representable in the type of the result, (a/b)*b + a%b
is equal to a.” - <a
href="https://timsong-cpp.github.io/cppwp/n3337/expr.mul">C++11 standard
draft N3337</a>, 5.6(4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both <code>knopen</code> and <code>7</code> are not negative
integers, so to discard the fractional part of <code>knopen / 7</code>
would mean taking its floor. So the line
<code>knopen += knopen + 7</code> basically defines the map</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathrm{knopen} \mapsto \mathrm{knopen} + \left \lfloor
\frac{\mathrm{knopen}}{7} \right \rfloor = \left \lfloor \mathrm{knopen}
+ \frac{\mathrm{knopen}}{7} \right \rfloor
\]</span></p>
<p>But as we showed at the start, this means the <code>knopen</code>
returned from the function cannot be congruent to <span
class="math inline">\(7 \pmod 8\)</span>.</p>
<p>And indeed that was what <a
href="https://groups.google.com/g/fishcooking/c/DygaIdBvJm0/m/NbJuijtnBQAJ">the
user</a> observed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The code is interesting in that it never reports a node count which
is 7 mod 8, which is externally observable.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To test this theory, <a
href="https://groups.google.com/g/fishcooking/c/DygaIdBvJm0/m/C5prRUNqBQAJ">another
user</a> took a game from a chess engine tournament between Houdini and
Stockfish and collated the nodes per second reported by both engines.
And lo and behold, Houdini <strong>never reported a node count congruent
to <span class="math inline">\(7 \pmod 8\)</span></strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“That’s a cool observation. Here is some evidence based on the
publicly available log file of TCEC game 68 (Stoofvlees-Houdini) in
current Divsion P: http://tinyurl.com/r63jr93</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Number of occurrences of reported nodes mod 8:”</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[292, 304, 296, 295, 291, 308, 289, 0]     (Houdini)
[240, 230, 234, 231, 243, 220, 215, 210]    (Stoofvlees)</code></pre>
<h3 id="whats-the-solution">What’s the solution?</h3>
<p>The best solution is to not rip off open source chess engines and
sell them, and this is the only solution I endorse. But if you are the
Houdini developer and wanna make some quick bucks, I will go over some
possible solutions in the next post of this (not really) thrilling
series.</p>
